                I'm a Minnesota Based Novice Coder. I aspire to be free lance and make my own company. The main focus of the company will be to code for small companies so I can make the work environment easier for everyone invovled and hopefully will help the economy one small business at a time.

                I coded in some classes in highschool and recently got introduced to the coding program I went through from a Coworker. I have gotten attached to front end javascript and enjoy trying to solve little problems with coding. I am very passionate and coding has opened a lot of doors for me.
